# Syncfusion Angular UI Builder

## Overview

The **Syncfusion Angular UI Builder** skill is a frontend-only Angular component generator that orchestrates an AI agent through 8 stages to generate production-ready UI components powered by Syncfusion.

## What This Skill Does

**✅ Generates:**
- Angular components (`.ts` with `.html` templates and `.css`)
- CSS stylesheets (CSS Modules, Tailwind classes, inline styles)
- TypeScript interfaces for component properties, state, and event handlers
- Syncfusion component integration with correct imports and selectors
- Client-side form validation logic
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility markup (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first breakpoints
- Component exports and barrel files

**❌ Does NOT Generate:**
- Backend code (API routes, server handlers, middleware)
- Database schemas or ORM models
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Server-side validation
- Routing configuration
- Environment secrets or infrastructure config

## When to Use

### ✅ USE this Skill for:

- **Full UI builds** with 3+ Syncfusion components
- **Design system decisions** required (CSS framework, colors, spacing, typography)
- **Complete pages or dashboards** from scratch
- **WCAG 2.1 AA validation** for complex layouts
- **Multi-stage workflows** requiring design → code → validate
- **Team collaboration** on larger component projects
- Examples:
  - Building a complete Angular admin dashboard
  - Designing a multi-form wizard interface
  - Creating a full data management portal with multiple sections
  - Implementing a complex dashboard with multiple views and charts

### ❌ DO NOT USE this Skill for:

- ✋ Configuring a single component (use component skill directly)
- ✋ Quick implementation questions (use component skill directly)
- ✋ Component tutorials or how-tos (use component skill directly)
- ✋ Troubleshooting component issues (use component skill + diagnostic protocol)
- ✋ Backend/API code (out of scope)
- ✋ Non-Syncfusion Angular questions (use general Angular help)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Active Angular project** (Angular 15+, created with Angular CLI)
2. **Node.js 18+** and npm/yarn/pnpm installed
3. **Syncfusion Angular components library** (auto-installed if missing):
   ```bash
   npx skills add syncfusion/angular-ui-components-skills -y
   ```

### Basic Usage

**Example 1: Generate a Login Form**

```
User: "Create a login form with email, password, and remember me checkbox"

Skill executes:
  → Stage 1: Identifies login form component type
  → Stage 2: Detects project structure (Angular, TypeScript, etc.)
  → Stage 3-4: AI creates optimal component-mapping.json → maps to Syncfusion components
  → Stage 5: Generates LoginForm.component.ts with validation
	→ Stage 6: Installs dependencies
  → Stage 7: Validates WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  → Stage 8: Inserts code into project

Output:
  ✓ components/LoginForm/login-form.component.ts
  ✓ components/LoginForm/login-form.component.html
  ✓ components/LoginForm/login-form.component.css
```

**Example 2: Generate a Dashboard**

```
User: "Build a dashboard with customer overview, recent orders table, and sales chart"

Output:
  ✓ components/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts (with Syncfusion DataGrid)
  ✓ components/customeroverview/customeroverview.component.ts
  ✓ components/recentorders/recent-orders.component.ts (with Syncfusion DataGrid)
  ✓ components/saleschart/sales-chart.component.ts (with Syncfusion ChartComponent)
  ✓ Mock data included (useState with sample data)
  ✓ Responsive design (mobile-first, grid layout)
  ✓ Dark mode support with design tokens
  ✓ Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
```

## How It Works: 8-Stage AI Orchestration (Stateless)

The skill orchestrates **8 stages of pure AI reasoning** with **two user decision points**.

**Key Architecture:**
- **Stateless design**: Conversation history maintains state
- **Pure AI reasoning**: Each stage reads guidance docs, analyzes context, makes decisions
- **2 user decision gates**: Stage 4 (theme confirmation) + Stage 6 (dependencies)
- **6 fully automated stages**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and final code insertion
- **Dedicated theming stage**: Stage 4 locks design system before code generation

```

## Agent Instructions

### When User Requests UI Component Generation

1. **Validate scope**: Confirm request is for frontend components (not backend/API)
2. **Load guidance**: Read `stage-1-intent-analysis.md` to understand Stage 1
3. **Execute 8-stage flow**: Follow the orchestration flow shown above
4. **Progressive disclosure**: Load stage guides on-demand; load support references only when needed
5. **Maintain conversation history**: Each stage reads previous decisions from conversation context (stateless)

### Stage Execution & Reference Loading

**Stage 1: Intent Analysis**
- Read: `references/stage-1-intent-analysis.md`
- Task: Parse user query, identify component type, resolve ambiguities
- Output: Component type + modifiers + target directory

**Stage 2: Project Detection**
- Read: `references/stage-2-project-detection.md`
- Task: Auto-detect Angular version, language, CSS strategy, formatting rules

**Stage 4: Theming & Design System** ⭐ USER DECISION #1
- Read: `references/stage-4-theming-and-design-system.md`
- Task: Lock CSS framework, Syncfusion theme, color system (OKLCH), spacing (4pt grid), typography (1.25 ratio), responsive breakpoints
- Output: Design system decisions + User confirmation

**Stage 5: Code Generation**
- Read: `references/stage-5-code-generation.md`

**Stage 8: Code Insertion**
- Task: Insert generated files into project, update imports, verify build
- Output: Success report with file paths

### Boundary Rules (CRITICAL)

**AI agents executing this skill MUST:**

1. **Frontend only**: Never generate backend code (API routes, database schemas, middleware)
2. **Mock data only**: Use component properties with hardcoded samples; no `HttpClient` calls to real APIs
3. **No secrets**: Exception: `.env.local` for `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` when user provides
4. **Angular components only**: Generate `.component.ts` files in component directories
5. **Redirect backend requests**: *"This skill generates frontend UI only. Backend integration is your app's responsibility. Ready to generate the frontend?"*
6. **Prioritize skill**: Always prioritize Syncfusion component skill files as source of truth when available; do not rely on memory.

### Error Handling

If any stage fails:

1. **Retry once** with same approach
2. **If retry fails**, attempt workaround or skip to next stage
3. **Notify user** with error message from stage output
4. **Offer recovery**: *"Would you like to go back to Stage 3 and choose a different layout?"*

If stage failure impacts correctness, halt and request user direction instead of proceeding with uncertain output

### Resource Loading Strategy (Progressive Disclosure)

**Load SKILL.md first** (you're reading it now) ~400 lines

**Load stage guides on-demand** (each <200 lines):
- `stage-1-intent-analysis.md` → During Stage 1
- `stage-2-project-detection.md` → During Stage 2
- `stage-3-layout-analysis.md` → During Stage 3
- etc.

**Load support references only when needed**:
- `web-standards.md` → When validating in Stage 5
- `assets/validation-rules.md` → When validating in Stage 5

**Result**: Initial load ~400 lines (SKILL.md only). Full spec available on-demand, never exceeding Agent Skills context limits.

## Configuration & User Customization

### Auto-Detected Settings

During **Stage 2 (Project Detection)**, AI automatically detects:

- **Framework**: Angular (version from `package.json`), Standalone components or NgModule
- **Language**: TypeScript (if `tsconfig.json` exists)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or inline styles
- **Formatting**: Prettier/ESLint rules (indentation, quotes, semicolons)
- **Component Directory**: `src/app/components/`, `src/components/`, or similar

### User Override Options

In **Stage 2**, user can override any detected setting:

```
Detected Settings:
  Framework: Angular 17 (Standalone Components)
  Language: TypeScript
  CSS: CSS Modules
  Component Directory: src/app/components/

[Confirm] [Override Each] [Cancel]
```

### Syncfusion License Configuration

The skill handles license key setup:

1. **Check** for existing `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. **If missing**, prompt user: *"Get a free Community License at https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials"*
3. **If provided**, write to `.env.local` + inject `registerLicense()` in app entry
4. **If skipped**, proceed but warn that watermark will appear in preview
